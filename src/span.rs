/// Spans typically consist of some context, such as the file they originated from, and a start/end offset. Spans are
/// permitted to overlap one-another. The end offset must always be greater than or equal to the start offset.
///
/// Span is automatically implemented for [`Range<T>`] and [`(C, Range<T>)`].

    /// Extra context used in a span.

    /// This is usually some way to uniquely identity the source file that a span originated in such as the file's
    /// path, URL, etc.

    /// means that it's perfectly fine for tokens to have non-continuous spans that bear no relation to their actual
    /// location in the input stream. This is useful for languages with an AST-level macro system that need to
