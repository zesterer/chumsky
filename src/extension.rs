//! Types and traits that let you write extensions for chumsky.
//!
//! Chumsky is a complicated crate that performs many internal optimizations to keep your parsers fast. These
//! optimizations mean that chumsky's core is rapidly changing, difficult to work with, and reveals a lot of
//! often-superfluous implementation details that are necessary to account for.
//!
//! In short: it's not a good basis for a stable public API upon which to build a parser ecosystem.
//!
//! To get around this problem, chumsky provides an extension interface (the contents of this module). This is a set of
//! types, traits, and functions that we've decided that we're comfortable providing long-term support for even if
//! the core of chumsky changes in an otherwise breaking manner in the future.
//!
//! The extension API is versioned. See the [`v1`] module for the current implementation of the API.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use chumsky::{prelude::*, input::InputRef, extension::v1::{ExtParser, Ext}};
//!
//! // An example extension parser that expects a null byte.
//! pub struct Null_;
//!
//! // We implement `ExtParser` for our null byte parser, plugging us into the chumsky ecosystem
//! impl<'a, I, E> ExtParser<'a, I, (), E> for Null_
//! where
//!     I: Input<'a, Token = u8>,
//!     E: extra::ParserExtra<'a, I>,
//! {
//!     fn parse(&self, inp: &mut InputRef<'a, '_, I, E>) -> Result<(), E::Error> {
//!         let before = inp.offset();
//!         match inp.next_maybe().as_deref() {
//!             // The next token was a null byte, meaning that parsing was successful
//!             Some(b'\0') => Ok(()),
//!             // The next token was something that wasn't a null byte, generate an error instead
//!             found => Err(E::Error::expected_found(
//!                 // Expected a null byte
//!                 core::iter::once(Some(b'\0'.into())),
//!                 // Found whatever the token was instead
//!                 found.copied().map(Into::into),
//!                 // The span of the error is the span of the token that was found instead
//!                 inp.span_since(before),
//!             )),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Finally, we create an easy way to name the parser type for users
//! pub type Null = Ext<Null_>;
//!
//! // It's also conventional to create a function to conveniently use the parser primitive
//! pub fn null() -> Null {
//!     Ext(Null_)
//! }
//!
//! // Let's give our parser a test!
//! fn make_parser<'a>() -> impl Parser<'a, &'a [u8], ()> {
//!     null()
//! }
//!
//! assert_eq!(make_parser().parse(b"\0").into_result(), Ok(()));
//! assert!(make_parser().parse(b"!").has_errors());
//! assert!(make_parser().parse(b"").has_errors());
//! ```
