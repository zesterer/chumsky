Although chumsky is designed primarily for user-facing parsers such as compilers, chumsky is just as much at home
parsing binary protocols at the networking layer, configuration files, or any other form of complex input validation
that you may need. It also has `no_std` support, making it suitable for embedded environments.

## Example

See [`examples/brainfuck.rs`](https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/blob/main/examples/brainfuck.rs) for a full
[Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter
(`cargo run --example brainfuck -- examples/sample.bf`).

```rust,ignore
use chumsky::prelude::*;

/// An AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) for Brainfuck instructions
#[derive(Clone)]
enum Instr {
    Left, Right,
    Incr, Decr,
    Read, Write,
    Loop(Vec<Self>), // In Brainfuck, `[...]` loop instructions contain any number of instructions
}

/// A function that generates a Brainfuck parser
fn brainfuck<'a>() -> impl Parser<'a, &'a str, Vec<Instr>> {
    // Brainfuck syntax is recursive: each instruction can contain many sub-instructions (via `[...]` loops)
    recursive(|bf| choice((
        // All of the basic instructions are just single characters
        just('<').to(Instr::Left),
        just('>').to(Instr::Right),
        just('+').to(Instr::Incr),
        just('-').to(Instr::Decr),
        just(',').to(Instr::Read),
        just('.').to(Instr::Write),
        // Loops are strings of Brainfuck instructions, delimited by square brackets
        bf.delimited_by(just('['), just(']')).map(Instr::Loop),
    ))
        // Brainfuck instructions appear sequentially, so parse as many as we need
        .repeated()
        .collect())
}

// Parse some Brainfuck with our parser
brainfuck().parse("--[>--->->->++>-<<<<<-------]>--.>---------.>--..+++.>----.>+++++++++.<<.+++.------.<-.>>+.")
```

## Guide and documentation

Chumsky has an extensive [guide](https://docs.rs/chumsky/latest/chumsky/guide) that walks you through the library: all
the way from setting up and basic theory to advanced uses of the crate. It includes technical details of chumsky's
behaviour, examples of uses, a handy index for all of the combinators, technical details about the crate, and even a
tutorial that leads you through the development of a fully-functioning interpreter for a simple programming language.

The crate docs should also be similarly useful: most important functions include at least one contextually-relevant
example, and all crate items are fully documented.

In addition, chumsky comes with a suite of fully-fledged
[example projects](https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky/tree/main/examples). These include:

- Parsers for existing syntaxes like Brainfuck and JSON
- Integration demos for third-party crates, like [`logos`](https://crates.io/crates/logos)
- Parsers for new toy programming languages: a Rust-like language and a full-on lexer, parser, type-checker, and
  interpreter for a minature ML-like language.
- Examples of parsing non-trivial inputs like token trees, `impl Read`ers, and zero-copy, zero-alloc parsing.

## Cargo features

Chumsky contains several optional features that extend the crate's functionality.

- `bytes`: adds support for parsing types from the [`bytes`](https://docs.rs/bytes/) crate.

- `either`: implements `Parser` for `either::Either`, allowing dynamic configuration of parsers at run-time

- `extension`: enables the extension API, allowing you to write your own first-class combinators that integrate with
  and extend chumsky

- `lexical-numbers`: Enables use of the `Number` parser for parsing various numeric formats

- `memoization`: enables [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization#Parsers) features

- `nightly`: enable support for features only supported by the nightly Rust compiler

- `pratt`: enables the [pratt parsing](https://matklad.github.io/2020/04/13/simple-but-powerful-pratt-parsing.html)
  combinator

- `regex`: enables the regex combinator

- `serde`: enables `serde` (de)serialization support for several types

- `stacker` (enabled by default): avoid stack overflows by spilling stack data to the heap via the `stacker` crate

- `std` (enabled by default): support for standard library features

- `unstable`: enables experimental chumsky features (API features enabled by `unstable` are NOT considered to fall
  under the semver guarantees of chumsky!)

## *What* is a parser combinator?

Parser combinators are a technique for implementing parsers by defining them in terms of other parsers. The resulting
parsers use a [recursive descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser) strategy to transform a stream
of tokens into an output. Using parser combinators to define parsers is roughly analogous to using Rust's
[`Iterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) trait to define iterative algorithms: the
type-driven API of `Iterator` makes it more difficult to make mistakes and easier to encode complicated iteration logic
than if one were to write the same code by hand. The same is true of parser combinators.

## *Why* use parser combinators?

Writing parsers with good error recovery is conceptually difficult and time-consuming. It requires understanding the
intricacies of the recursive descent algorithm, and then implementing recovery strategies on top of it. If you're
developing a programming language, you'll almost certainly change your mind about syntax in the process, leading to some
slow and painful parser refactoring. Parser combinators solve both problems by providing an ergonomic API that allows
for rapidly iterating upon a syntax.

Parser combinators are also a great fit for domain-specific languages for which an existing parser does not exist.
Writing a reliable, fault-tolerant parser for such situations can go from being a multi-day task to a half-hour task
with the help of a decent parser combinator library.

## Classification

Chumsky's parsers are [recursive descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser) parsers and are
capable of parsing [parsing expression grammars (PEGs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar), which
includes all known context-free languages. However, chumsky doesn't stop there: it also supports context-sensitive
grammars via a set of dedicated combinators that integrate cleanly with the rest of the library. This allows it to
additionally parse a number of context-sensitive syntaxes like Rust-style raw strings, Python-style semantic
indentation, and much more.

## Error recovery

Chumsky has support for error recovery, meaning that it can encounter a syntax error, report the error, and then
attempt to recover itself into a state in which it can continue parsing so that multiple errors can be produced at once
and a partial [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) can still be generated from the input for future
compilation stages to consume.

## Performance

Chumsky allows you to choose your priorities. When needed, it can be configured for high-quality parser errors. It can
also be configured for *performance*.

It's difficult to produce general benchmark results for parser libraries. By their nature, the performance of a parser
is intimately tied to exactly how the grammar they implement has been specified. That said, here are some numbers for a
fairly routine JSON parsing benchmark implemented idiomatically in various libraries. As you can see, chumsky ranks
quite well!

| Ranking | Library                                              | Time (smaller is better) | Throughput |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| 1       | `chumsky` (check-only)                               | 140.77 µs                | 797 MB/s   |
| 2       | [`winnow`](https://github.com/winnow-rs/winnow)      | 178.91 µs                | 627 MB/s   |
| 3       | `chumsky`                                            | 210.43 µs                | 533 MB/s   |
| 4       | [`sn`](https://github.com/Jacherr/sn) (hand-written) | 237.94 µs                | 472 MB/s   |
| 5       | [`serde_json`](https://github.com/serde-rs/json)     | 477.41 µs                | 235 MB/s   |
| 6       | [`nom`](https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom)          | 526.52 µs                | 213 MB/s   |
| 7       | [`pest`](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest)        | 1.9706 ms                | 57 MB/s    |
| 8       | [`pom`](https://github.com/J-F-Liu/pom)              | 13.730 ms                | 8 MB/s     |

What should you take from this? It's difficult to say. 'Chumsky is faster than X' or 'chumsky is slower than Y' is too
strong a statement: this is just one particular benchmark with one particular set of implementations and one
particular workload.

That said, there is something you can take: chumsky isn't going to be your bottleneck. In this benchmark, chumsky is
within 20% of the performance of the 'pack leader' and has performance comparable to a hand-written parser. The
performance standards for Rust libraries are already far above most language ecosystems, so you can be sure that
chumsky will keep pace with your use-case.

Benchmarks were performed on a single core of an AMD Ryzen 7 3700x.
